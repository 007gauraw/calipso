Calipso is a simple NodeJS content management system, built along similar themes to Drupal and Wordpress, that is designed to be fast, flexible and simple.

For additional detail, please visit the home page: "http://calip.so/":http://calip.so/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=calipso&utm_campaign=github

If you would like to contribute, please take a look at the issues list as this will have the most up to date view of work that needs to be done for the next minor release.  Otherwise, please just pm myself (cliftonc) or dennis (dennishall) and we can suggest some palces for you to start.

<h3>Ok, now grab all the dependencies via NPM</h3>
<p>Calipso depends on a number of other libraries that are available through NPM (the Node Package Manager).  If all of these dependencies aren't installed, you will get lots of errors when attempting to run Calipso</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
$ npm install
npm info it worked if it ends with ok
npm info using npm@0.3.15
npm info using node@v0.4.2
npm info link /var/www/tmp/calipso

...
<<YOU WILL SEE LOTS OF DOWNLOADS DEPENDENDING ON WHAT YOU ALREADY HAVE INSTALLED>>
...

npm ok

</pre>
<h3>Ok - lets run it!</h3>
<p>Now the first test, try to run it!</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">

<p>Now, if you browse to:<p>
<p><a href="http://localhost:3000/" target="_new">http://localhost:3000</a></p>
<p>You should see the home screen, along with a message that the site has been configured with a default Administrative user and password.  You should login with this, and then change it immediately (you can do this from the Admin users profile page).<p>
<h3>What next?</h3>
<p>Ok - you're now up and running, you should be able to login, and once logged in begin to navigate the content creation and administration screens.</p>
