Details to come, but this is a NodeJS CMS, modular, based on Drupal Module / Theme concepts, runs on Mongodb via MongooseJS.

If you want to use it, simply clone from github, make sure you have all of the dependencies installed, and run node app.

Thoughts / TODO :

 * I wanted a CMS that enabled a 'block' build up style leveraging the asynch nature of node.  e.g. On a request, a set of modules would intercept the request chain in an asynch manner, and build up blocks in the output (as both JSON and pre-rendered HTML so that each module can create its own look and feel, or you can completely override it from your theme).
 * A theme system.
 * The core modules required to make it work.
 * Needs tests - lots of them!
 * Very early days, still have some issues re. ordering (given the asynch), dependencies between modules (ditto).

Any early feedback would be great!
